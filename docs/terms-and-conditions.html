## 1. INTRODUCTION

Welcome to my hobbyist software applications ("Apps"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of any software applications, websites, or services (collectively, the "Apps") that I develop and maintain as a hobby project.

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Apps.

## 5. PRIVACY

My Privacy Policy describes how I collect, use, and disclose information about you. By using the Apps, you consent to the processing of your information as explained in the Privacy Policy.

## 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

### 6.1 Ownership
The Apps, including all content, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof), are owned by me and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.

### 6.2 Feedback
If you provide me with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Apps, you hereby assign to me all rights in such feedback and agree that I shall have the right to use such feedback in any manner I deem appropriate.

## 7. THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES

The Apps may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by me. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that I shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.

## 8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

THE APPS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, I EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. I MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE APPS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE APPS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS, IF ANY, WILL BE CORRECTED.

## 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL I BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APPS.

## 10. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold me harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Apps or your violation of these Terms.

## 11. TERM AND TERMINATION

### 11.1 Term
These Terms shall remain in effect until terminated by you or me.

### 11.2 Termination by You
You may terminate these Terms at any time by ceasing all use of the Apps and deleting all copies of the Apps from your devices.

### 11.3 Termination by Me
I may, in my sole discretion, terminate these Terms and your access to all or part of the Apps, at any time and for any reason, without prior notice or liability.

### 11.4 Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your right to use the Apps will immediately cease. All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification.

## 12. CHANGES TO TERMS

I reserve the right, at my sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. I will make reasonable efforts to provide notice of any material changes. What constitutes a material change will be determined at my sole discretion. By continuing to access or use the Apps after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

## 13. GOVERNING LAW

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

## 14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 14.1 Informal Resolution
If you have any concern or dispute about the Apps, you agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting me.

### 14.2 Binding Arbitration
If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Apps shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of [Your Country/State]. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party.

## 15. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## 16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and me regarding your use of the Apps and supersede all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between you and me.

## 17. CHILDREN'S USE

The Apps are not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). If you are under 13 years of age, please do not use or access the Apps at any time or in any manner.

## 18. EXPORT REGULATION

The Apps may be subject to export laws and regulations. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to embargo by [Your Country] or that has been designated as a "terrorist supporting" country, and you are not listed on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

## 19. CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact me at the email address provided in Section 2.

## 20. FORCE MAJEURE

I will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from causes beyond my reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, pandemic, war, terrorism, riots, civil unrest, government action, labor disputes, or technical failures beyond my control.

## 21. ASSIGNMENT

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without my prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms without such consent will be null and of no effect. I may assign or transfer these Terms, at my sole discretion, without restriction.

## 22. WAIVER

No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and my failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
